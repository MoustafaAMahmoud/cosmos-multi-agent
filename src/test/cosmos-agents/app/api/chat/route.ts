          content: `Azure Cosmos DB is an excellent choice for building a globally distributed e-commerce product catalog with millions of products. Here's why, along with guidance on data modeling considerations:

## Why Cosmos DB is Suitable:

1. **Global Distribution with Low Latency**:
   - Cosmos DB allows you to replicate your data across multiple regions, ensuring low-latency access for users worldwide.
   - It provides multi-region writes, which is beneficial for scenarios where updates to the catalog might come from different regions.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Cosmos DB is highly scalable and can handle millions of products with ease, supporting high throughput for reads and writes.

3. **Flexible Data Modeling**:
   - Cosmos DB supports schema-less data, making it ideal for storing diverse product attributes (e.g., electronics, clothing, etc.) without needing a predefined schema.

4. **APIs for Diverse Needs**:
   - The SQL API is typically the best choice for e-commerce catalogs due to its query capabilities and support for hierarchical JSON data.

5. **Consistency Models**:
   - Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels, allowing you to balance between strong consistency (for critical updates) and eventual consistency (for faster reads).

## Data Modeling for Product Catalog:

For your e-commerce product catalog, I recommend the following data model structure:

1. **Product Container**:
   - Document ID: Unique product identifier
   - Properties: name, description, brand, price, category, images, attributes
   - Partition key: Consider using category or brand depending on your query patterns

2. **Category Container**:
   - Document ID: Category identifier
   - Properties: name, description, parent category (for hierarchical categories)
   - Partition key: parent category or top-level category

3. **Inventory Container**:
   - Document ID: SKU or product variant identifier
   - Properties: productId, location, quantity, status
   - Partition key: location or productId

This model allows for efficient queries across your catalog while maintaining the flexibility to handle diverse product types.`,
        }

        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(finalResponse)))
        controller.close()
      },
    })

    return new NextResponse(stream, {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "text/plain",
      },
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing chat request:", error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to process request" }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
